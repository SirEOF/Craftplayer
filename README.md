== CraftPlayer ==
A Minecraft SMP library for iOS.
Name sucks. We'll probably rename it in the future.
Code on the GIT repo is under the GNU GPL license.

== Credits ==
ac3xx: Started on Obj-C port; Provided private repo; IRC support; Obj-C coding.
qwertyoruiop: original python lib "libcraftpacket" used to test Minecraft servers and Obj-C coding.

== TODO ==
Add packets. Each packet has to be implemented async, so it's a bit of a pain, both coding and CPU-wise. Some caching might lower the CPU usage.
Documentation.
Testing.
