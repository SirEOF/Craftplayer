You provide the IP address, an username and a password (not required for offline mode servers), Craftplayer connects to the server and notifies your delegate about incoming packets, pre-parsed.\r\n\r\n### Demo PoC application\r\nWe at the Craftplayer project are working on something bigger, a full client.\r\nHowever, Craftplayer provides a solid backend for all your Minecraft SMP projects for iOS.\r\nWe made a demo application that hooks chat and disconnect messages and let you chat on any Minecraft server , with any nickname/password. \r\nWith just a few lines of code, we set up a connection and hooked chat (0x03) packets. We then receive a message to our delegate class that informs the UI about the message. Strings are automatically converted by the backend.\r\n\r\n### Need more support?\r\nWe know, developing an application off some sourcecode is generally hard without documentation.\r\nHowever, Craftplayer's so simple it requires little to no documentation at all.\r\nYou could still encounter issues. For bugs, raise an issue ticket on Github. For general talk and implementation help, join our dedicated IRC Support channel over at irc.nightcoast.net #CraftMe.\r\nWe'd love to have a chat with users of our project :)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMain devs are @qwertyoruiop and @ac3xx. Short and simple.\r\nIf you want to join our team, ping us on IRC. We are always needing more brains behind this project! \r\nEnjoy:)","name":"Craftplayer","tagline":"iOS Minecraft SMP Library","google":""}
